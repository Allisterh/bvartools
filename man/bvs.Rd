\title{Bayesian Variable Selection}
\usage{
bvs(y, z, a, lambda, sigma_i, prob_prior, include = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a \eqn{K \times T} matrix of the endogenous variables.}

\item{z}{a \eqn{KT \times M} matrix of explanatory variables.}

\item{a}{an M-dimensional vector of parameter draws. If time varying parameters are used,
an \eqn{M \times T} coefficient matrix can be provided.}

\item{lambda}{an \eqn{M \times M} inclusion matrix that should be updated.}

\item{sigma_i}{the inverse variance-covariance matrix. If the variance-covariance matrix
is time varying, a \eqn{KT \times K} matrix can be provided.}

\item{prob_prior}{an M-dimensional vector of prior inclusion probabilities.}

\item{include}{an integer vector specifying the positions of variables, which should be
included in the BVS algorithm. If \code{NULL} (default), BVS will be applied to all variables.}
}
\value{
A matrix of inclusion parameters on its diagonal.
}
\description{
\code{bvs} employs Bayesian variable selection as proposed by Korobilis (2013)
to produce a vector of inclusion parameters for the coefficient matrix
of a VAR model.
}
\details{
The function employs Bayesian variable selection as proposed
by Korobilis (2013) to produce a vector of inclusion parameters, which are
the diagonal elements of the inclusion matrix \eqn{\Lambda} for the VAR model
\deqn{y_t = Z_t \Lambda a_t + u_t,}
where \eqn{u_t \sim N(0, \Sigma_{t})}.
\eqn{y_t} is a K-dimensional vector of endogenous variables and
\eqn{Z_t = x_t^{\prime} \otimes I_K} is a \eqn{K \times M} matrix of regressors with
\eqn{x_t} as a vector of regressors.
