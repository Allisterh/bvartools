\description{
The function `bvec` is used to create objects of class "bvec".
}
\details{
The function collects the output of a Gibbs sampler in a standardised object,
which can be used as input for further analyis such as forecasting and impulse
response analysis.

The notation corresponds to the following model
\deqn{y_t = \Pi ECT_{t} +  \sum_{i=1}^p Gamma_i y_{t-i} + \sum_{i=0}^s Ypsilon_i x_{t-i} + A_0 u_t,}
with \eqn{\Pi = \alpha \beta'} and \eqn{u_t \sim \Sigma}.
