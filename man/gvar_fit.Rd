\title{Fitter Function for GVAR Models}
\usage{
gvar_fit(data, iterations = 50000, burnin = 5000, thin = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a list of data and model specifications for country-specific models and information on the global
VAR model as produced by the \code{country_models} function.}

\item{iterations}{an integer of MCMC draws including burn-in (defaults to 50000).}

\item{burnin}{an integer of MCMC draws used to initialize the sampler (defaults to 5000).
These draws do not enter the computation of posterior moments, forecasts etc.}

\item{thin}{an integer of thinning factor for MCMC output. Defaults to 10, which means that the
forecast sequences contain only every tenth draw of the original sequence. Set \code{thin = 1} to obtain the full MCMC sequence.}
}
\value{
A list of data, model specifications, priors, thinned coefficient draws and information
criteria for each estimated country model, which are the output of the function \code{\link{estimate_country_model}}.
}
\description{
Estimates the country models of a GVAR model, combines them and solves the global model.
}
\details{
The function applies the function \code{estimate_country_models} to each country model.
If \code{sfInit} was specified before, the estmation of each country model is distributed
across multiple cores by the load balancing function \code{sfClusterApplyLB}. Otherwise,
the estimations will be performed sequentially on a single core.
