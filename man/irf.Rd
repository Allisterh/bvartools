\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class "bvar", usually, a result of a call to `bvar` or `bvec_to_bvar`.}

\item{impulse}{name of the impulse variable.}

\item{response}{name of the response variable.}

\item{n.ahead}{number of steps ahead.}

\item{shock}{size of the impulse shock.}

\item{ci}{a numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the probability mass covered by the
credible intervals. Defaults to 0.95.}

\item{type}{type of the impulse resoponse. Possible choices are forecast error `feir`
(default), orthogonalised `oir`, structural `sir`, and generalised `gir` impulse responses.}

\item{cumulative}{logical specifying whether a cumulative IRF should be calculated.}

\item{x}{an object of class "bvarirf", usually, a result of a call to \code{\link{irf}}.}

\item{...}{further graphical parameters.}
}
\value{
A time-series object of class "bvarirf".
}
\description{
Computes the impulse response coefficients of an object of class "bvar" for
`n.ahead` steps.

A plot function for objects of class "bvarirf".
}
\details{
The function produces different types of impulse responses for the VAR model
\deqn{A_0 y_t = \sum_{i = 1}^{p} A_{i} y_{t-i} + u_t,}
with \eqn{u_t \sim N(0, \Sigma)}.

Forecast error impulse responses \eqn{\Phi_i} are obtained by recursions
\deqn{\Phi_i = \sum_{j = 1}^{i} \Phi_{i-j} A_j,   i = 1, 2,...,}
with \eqn{\Phi_0 = I_K}.

Orthogonalised impulse responses \eqn{\Theta^o_i} are calculated as \eqn{\Theta^o_i = \Phi_i P,}
where P is the lower triangular Choleski decomposition of \eqn{\Sigma}.

Structural impulse responses \eqn{\Theta^s_i} are calculated as \eqn{\Theta^s_i = \Phi_i A_0^{-1}}.

Generalised impulse responses for variable \eqn{j}, i.e. \eqn{\Theta^g_ji} are calculated as
\eqn{\Theta^g_ji = \sigma_{jj}^{-1/2} \Phi_i \Sigma e_j}, where \eqn{\sigma_{jj}} is the variance
of the \eqn{j^{th}} diagonal element of \eqn{\Sigma} and \eqn{e_i} is a selection vector containing
one in its \eqn{j^{th}} element and zero otherwise.
