\title{Posterior Draw from Normal Distribution}
\usage{
post_normal(y, x, Sigma_i, mu_prior, V_i_prior)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{\eqn{n x T} matrix containing the time series of the dependent variable.}

\item{x}{\eqn{k x T} matrix containing the time series of the explanatory variables.}

\item{Sigma_i}{inverse of the \eqn{n x n} variance-covariance matrix.}

\item{mu_prior}{\eqn{m x 1} numeric vector containing the prior mean of the coefficients.}

\item{V_i_prior}{inverse of the \eqn{m x m} covariance matrix of the coefficients.}
}
\value{
A \eqn{m x 1} vector of coefficient values.
}
\description{
Produces a draw from a posterior density of a Gaussian process and normal prior.
}
\details{
The function produces a vectorised draw of the \eqn{n x k} coefficient
matrix \eqn{A} of the model
\deqn{y_{t} = A x_{t} a + \epsilon_{t},}
where \eqn{y_{t}} is a \eqn{n x 1} vector of endogenous variables in period \eqn{t},
\eqn{x_{t}} is a \eqn{k x 1} vector of explanatory variables, and the error term
\eqn{\epsilon_{t}} is normally distributed with zero mean and variance-covariance
matrix \eqn{\Sigma}. \eqn{k} is the number of explanatory variables and \eqn{m} it
the total number of estimated coefficients.
