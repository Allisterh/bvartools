\title{Create a Weight Matrix}
\usage{
create_weights(weight.data, period, country.data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight.data}{a list of named time series or a matrix containing data for the construction of weights.}

\item{period}{an integer for time varying weights or a numeric vector specifying the periods used to calculate constant weights (see 'Details').}

\item{country.data}{a named list of time series containing country data. Only requried if \code{period} is an integer.}
}
\value{
A named matrix or array containing country-specific weight matrices.
}
\description{
Produces a matrix of fixed weights or an array of time varying weights from raw data for a GVAR model.
}
\details{
The function assists in the creation of country-specific weight matrices from raw data. If a numeric vector
is provided for \code{period}, the function will calculate country weights based on the sums over the
specified periods. If an integer is proved, the weights will be construced from rolling sums over the last \code{period} periods.
If the country data starts earlier than the weight series, the sums over the first \code{period} observations
of \code{weight.data} will be used until the periods match.
}
\examples{
# Constant weight matrix 
data(gvar2016)

weight.data <- gvar2016$weight.data
period <- 2008:2012

weight.data <- create_weights(weight.data, period)


# Time varying weight matrix
data(gvar2016)

weight.data <- gvar2016$weight.data
country.data <- gvar2016$country.data
period <- 3

weight.data <- create_weights(weight.data, period, country.data)

}
