\title{Contemporaneous Coefficients}
\usage{
get_contemp_coefs(data, type = "mean", t = NULL, all = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a list containing the solved GVAR model as produced by \code{\link{solve_gvar}}.}

\item{type}{a character specifying the type of statistic that should be calculated.
Possible option are "mean" (default), "median" and "sd".}

\item{t}{a numeric specifying the time index of the coefficients. Only applicable if the country models were
estimated with time-varying parameters or stochastic volatility.
If \code{NULL} the latest or only available period will be used.}

\item{all}{a logical. If \code{TRUE}, the contemporaneous effects of all estimated models will be printed. Otherwise, only
those models will be considered, which enter the global model.}
}
\value{
A data frame.
}
\description{
Calculates statistics for draws of contemporaneous coefficients of foreign variables on their domestic counterpart
for each country model, which was used to construct the global model.
