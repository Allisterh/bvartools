\usage{
add_BVS_prior(data, kappa_domestic = 0.9, kappa_foreign = 0.5,
  kappa_global = 0.5, kappa_A0 = 0.5, kappa_deterministic = 0.8,
  exclude_deterministic = TRUE, exclude_own_lags = FALSE,
  structural = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a list of country models as produced by \code{\link{country_models}}.}

\item{kappa_domestic}{number between 0 and 1.}

\item{kappa_foreign}{number between 0 and 1.}

\item{kappa_global}{number between 0 and 1.}

\item{kappa_A0}{number between 0 and 1.}

\item{kappa_deterministic}{number between 0 and 1.}

\item{exclude_deterministic}{logical; exclude deterministic terms from the BVS algorithm?}

\item{exclude_own_lags}{logical; exclude the first own lags from the BVS algorithm?}

\item{structural}{logical; should BVS should also be applied to structual coefficients?}
}
\description{
Adds prior hyperparameters for Bayesian variable selection to every country model.
