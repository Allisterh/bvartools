\usage{
get_inclusion_probabilities(data, all = FALSE, decimal = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a list containing the solved GVAR model as produced by \code{\link{solve_gvar}}.}

\item{all}{a logical. If \code{TRUE}, the contemporaneous effects of all estimated models will be printed. Otherwise, only
those models will be considered, which enter the global model.}
}
\value{
A list of matrices.
}
\description{
Calculates the inclusion probablities of variable in a country model, where BVS or SSVS were used.
