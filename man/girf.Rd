\title{Generalised Impulse Response of a GVAR Model}
\usage{
girf(data, n.ahead = 20, impulse, response, shock = "sd", ci = 0.95,
  draws = NULL, t = NULL, mean = FALSE, cumulative = FALSE,
  structural = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a list containing a solved GVAR model as produced by \code{\link{solve_gvar}}.}

\item{n.ahead}{an integer specifying the steps.}

\item{impulse}{a character vector containing the country name and variable of the impulse.}

\item{response}{a character vector containing the country name and variable of the response.}

\item{shock}{a character or numeric specifying the size of the shock. Either "sd" (default), "nsd" for negative standard deviation of the impulse variable or a numeric value.}

\item{ci}{a numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the probability mass covered by the credible intervals.}

\item{draws}{a numeric specifying the number of draws from the GVAR model used to calculate the GIR.}

\item{t}{an integer specifying the period for which the GIR should be calculated. Only used if a GVAR with time-varying
parameters or stochastic volatility was estimated.}

\item{mean}{a logical. If \code{TRUE}, the means of the coefficient draws will be used to calculate a
single impulse response with no credible intervals.}

\item{cumulative}{a logical. If \code{TRUE}, a cumulative GIR will be calculated.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\item{IR}{a "zoo" object containing the median and credible intervals of the GIR.}
\item{impulse}{a character vector containing the country name and variable of the impulse.}
\item{response}{a character vector containing the country name and variable of the response.}
}
\description{
Computes the generalised impulse response (GIR) coefficients of a GVAR model.
