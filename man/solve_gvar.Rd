\title{Solve a GVAR Model}
\usage{
solve_gvar(data, ic = "BIC", t = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a list containing the results of the country estimates.}

\item{ic}{a character specifying the information criterion used for model selection. Available options are "AIC", "BIC" (default) and "HQ".
were estimated with time varying parameters.}
}
\value{
A list containing two components:
\item{Country.models}{a list of the results of all estimated country models as produced by \code{\link{estimate_country_model}}.}
\item{GVAR}{a list containing the data of the global model, the country-specific link matrices and a variable index as produced by the function \code{\link{country_models}}.}
}
\description{
Combines the country model results to a global VAR model and solves it.
}
\details{
If multiple country models were estimated with \code{\link{gvar_fit}}, the function will choose the model, which
maximises the specified information criterion specified by \code{ic}.
