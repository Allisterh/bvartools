## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Shortened the calculation time of the re-building of vignette outputs

In former resubmissions I have:

* Omitted the redundant part "Functions for" in the title
* Added small executeable examples in Rd-files of functions, which are used for simulation. Functions which build on the output of computationally intensive simulations are covered in the vignettes.
* Rewritten the Description field in DESCRIPTION
* Reformated the references in the Description field in DESCRIPTION

## Test environments
ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R-devel, R 3.5.2, R 3.4.4, R 3.3.3
win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

* NOTE: New submission
* NOTE: checking installed package size ... installed size is  7.7Mb sub-directories of 1Mb or more: libs 6.9Mb
