## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reformulated the description in DESCRIPTION
* Reformated the references in the Description field in DESCRIPTION
* Clarified that I am not using RcppArmadillo code. I am only using the package as a bridge to the C++ Armadillo library.

In addition I have:

* Added inst/CITATION
* Renamed an argument in 'fevd'
* Changed R dependency from 3.2.0 to 3.3.0

## Test environments
ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R-devel, R 3.5.2, R 3.4.4, R 3.3.3
win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
